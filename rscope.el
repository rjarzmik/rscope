;;; rscope.el --- Reborn cscope interface for emacs
;;
;; Copyright(c) 2014 Robert Jarzmik <robert.jarzmik@free.fr>
;; Authors: Robert Jarzmik <robert.jarzmik@free.fr>
;; Keywords: code
;; Licence: GPLv2
;; Version 0.1
;;
;; Heavily inspired by ascope, relies on :
;;   - pre-launched cscope processes
;;   - auto finding of the best suited cscope process (based on file directory)
;;   - auto finding cscope databases, customizable
;;   - has navigation and preview capability in rscope result buffer

;; Usage:
;;   load this script using (require 'rscope) in you .emacs
;;   M-x rscope-init load one of the cscope databases.
;;     This command must be issue prior to issue any other command below, the
;;     directory fed to this command must be the directory holding the cscope.out
;;     file.
;;     Alternatively, if a cscope.out exists in the directory tree, don't bother
;;     doing a rscope-init command, it will work out automatically.
;;   M-x find-file "myfile.c"
;;   M-x rscope-find-this-symbol
;;     Find a symbol from the database.

;; Result buffer navigation (*Result*)
;;   Normal keystrokes :
;;     Use "n" to navigate to next entry in results
;;     Use "p" to navigate to previsous entry in results
;;     Use ENTER bury result buffer and switch to the previewed entry
;;     Use "q" to bury result buffer and switch to other window.
;;
;;   Advanced keystrokes:
;;     Use SPACE to preview an entry
;;     Use Ctr-ENTER to bury result buffer, and replace it by the selected entry
;;     Use number <N> to develop all subtrees up to Nth level (0 => expand all)
;;     Use "+" to expand a collapsed tree
;;     Use "-" to collapse a tree

;; Available global commands (bound by default to C-c s [gstCcia])
;;
;; M-x rscope-find-global-definition
;; M-x rscope-find-this-symbol
;; M-x rscope-find-this-text-string
;; M-x rscope-find-functions-calling-this-function
;; M-x rscope-find-called-functions
;; M-x rscope-find-files-including-file
;; M-x rscope-all-symbol-assignments
;; M-x rscope-pop-mark

;; Advanced users guide :
;;  - pay attention to cusotmizable variables
;;  - don't do anymore any rscope-init command, implement a hook in
;;    rscope-autoinit-cscope-dir-hooks
;;      (see rscope-autoinit-path-upwards-cscope_out)
