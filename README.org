* Introduction
This is "yet" another interface to cscope tool (http://cscope.sf.net) for emacs.

It provides the same information as its backend cscope :
 - what functions are calling a function
 - where is a global symbol
 - what is the calling hierarchy of a function

* Usage
** Quick-start
1. Download rscope.el
2. Evaluate it
  - (load "rscope.el")

** Source browsing
Once loaded, each C/C++ file will be offered all the "C-C s" key prefix
bindings, providing access to the rscope functions.

You can experiment by :
1. Have a cscope database generated somewhere
2. Load a C file
3. Use a command, for example type "C-c s g"

** Global keys launching source browsing
All keybindings use the "C-c s" prefix:
 | C-c s s | Find symbol.                                                   |
 | C-c s = | Find assignments to this symbol                                |
 | C-c s d | Find global definition.                                        |
 | C-c s g | Find global definition (alternate binding).                    |
 | C-c s c | Find functions calling a function.                             |
 | C-c s C | Find called functions (list functions called from a function). |
 | C-c s t | Find text string.                                              |
 | C-c s f | Find a file.                                                   |
 | C-c s h | Find calling hierarchy of a function                           |

** The *Result* buffer keys
 - Normal keystrokes :
   - Use "n" to navigate to next entry in results
   - Use "p" to navigate to previsous entry in results
   - Use ENTER bury result buffer and switch to the previewed entry
   - Use "q" to bury result buffer and switch to other window.
 - Advanced keystrokes:
   - Use SPACE to preview an entry
   - Use Ctr-ENTER to bury result buffer, and replace it by the selected entry
   - Use number <N> to develop current leaf's subtree up to Nth level

* Goal
It is born to challenge its cousins :
 - xscope
 - ascope
 - bscope

The main advantages of this interface WRT to its elders are :
 - cscope process are spwaned only once for a give cscope.out
 - multiple cscope database are allowed
 - automatic cscope database is provided
 - previews of results
 - buffer number limitation (ie. close preview buffers, close buffers with
   pop-mark when they haven't been touched)

Once one of the cousins will have achieved the same functionnalities, it will
slip in slumber.
